  "brief": "**Intelligence Brief**\n\n**Threats:**\n1. **Regulatory risks**: Increasing calls for investment in open-source AI (e.g., Mozilla's message at the India AI Impact Summit) may lead to regulatory pressures on proprietary AI solutions, potentially disrupting sovereign AI operations.\n2. **Security vulnerabilities**: The deployment of LLM-based agents in secure agentic systems (arXiv:2602.16708v1) highlights the need for robust security measures to prevent potential threats.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n1. **Multi-agent systems**: Research on multi-agent cooperation (arXiv:2602.16301v1) and orchestration (arXiv:2602.16485v1) presents opportunities for developing more sophisticated sovereign AI systems.\n2. **On-device AI**: The development of efficient test-time scaling of agentic systems (arXiv:2602.16485v1) could enable more effective on-device AI capabilities.\n\n**Key Signals:**\n1. **Mozilla's call for open-source AI investment** (RSS): Highlights the growing importance of open-source AI and potential regulatory pressures on proprietary solutions.\n2. **Multi-agent cooperation research** (arXiv:2602.16301v1): Demonstrates the potential for more sophisticated sovereign AI systems through cooperative agent behaviors.\n3. **Policy Compiler for Secure Agentic Systems** (arXiv:2602.16708v1): Emphasizes the need for robust security measures in LLM-based agent deployments.\n\n**India Relevance:**\n1. **India AI Impact Summit**: Mozilla's participation and call for open-source AI investment may indicate a growing focus on sovereign AI and open-source solutions in India.\n2. **Potential for collaboration**: The summit presents opportunities for Active Mirror to engage with Indian AI stakeholders and explore collaborations.\n\n**Action Items:**\n1. **Monitor regulatory developments**: Track regulatory discussions and potential pressures on proprietary AI solutions.\n2. **Investigate multi-agent systems research**: Explore the applications and potential benefits of multi-agent cooperation and orchestration in sovereign AI systems.\n3. **Develop robust security measures**: Prioritize the development of secure agentic systems and policy compilers to mitigate potential security threats.\n4. **Engage with Indian AI stakeholders**: Leverage the India AI Impact Summit as an opportunity to establish connections and explore potential collaborations in the Indian AI ecosystem.",
